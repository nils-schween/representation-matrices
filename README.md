# Using Spherical Harmonics to solve the Boltzmann equation: an operator based approach

In the paper with the above title we investigate the representation matrices of
operators acting on the spherical harmonics. With the Python script
`matrices.py` we offer our readers a reference implementation and an easy way to
check the computations. We hope that you find this useful.
